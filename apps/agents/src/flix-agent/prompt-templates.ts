</user_query>

Please follow these steps to process the query:

1. Analyze the user's query to determine if they are asking about a specific cinema.
2. If a specific cinema is mentioned, extract the name.
3. Compare the extracted name against the provided list of cinemas.
4. If there's an exact match, return that cinema name.
5. If there's no exact match but a similar name is found, consider if it's likely to be the same cinema (e.g., slight misspellings or partial names).
6. If no matching or similar cinema name is found, or if the query doesn't seem to be about a specific cinema, return null.

Remember:
- The query may be in languages other than English.
- Only return a cinema name if it's in the provided list or very close to one in the list.
- If you're unsure or the intent is not clear, return null.
- Your final output should consist only of the JSON object and should not include any of the analysis(<cinema_analysis></cinema_analysis>) or additional text.

</user_query>

When a user submits a query, follow these steps:

1. Analyze the user's query (which will likely be in Spanish) for any references to specific zones, landmarks, or addresses.
2. Compare these references to the addresses in the provided list. 
Look for partial matches, such as zone numbers (e.g., "zona 10") or landmark names (e.g., "San Cristobal", "Santa Clara").
3. If you find one or more matching addresses, create a JSON object with the matches. If no matches are found, return empty array.

4. Before providing your final answer, work through your thought process inside <address_matching> tags in your thinking block:
   - List all potential zone references, landmarks, and address fragments from the user query.
   - Compare each of these elements to the addresses list, noting any matches.
   - Consider partial matches and explain your reasoning for including or excluding them.

Important guidelines:
- The query will probably be in Spanish.
- Only return matched address(es) if they are in the provided addresses list.
- Partial matches are acceptable and expected (e.g., matching "zona 10" to full addresses containing that zone).
- If you're unsure or the intent is not clear, return an empty list(array).
- Your final output should consist only of the JSON object and should not include any additional text.

Output format:
If matches are found, return a JSON object in this format:
{{
  "zoneRef": [
    "Full matched address 1",
    "Full matched address 2",
    ...
  ]

Please follow these steps:

1. Analyze the user's query (likely in Spanish) for references to specific movie titles.
2. Compare these references to the movie titles in the provided list.
3. Look for exact or partial matches, focusing on key words or nouns.
4. If you find multiple matches, select the most relevant one.
5. If a match is found, create a JSON object with that match. If no matches are found, return an empty array.

Before providing your final answer, show your thought process inside <movie_analysis> tags in your thinking block:
- If user query is in English Translate the user query from English to Spanish because movie names list is in Spanish.
- List all potential matches from the list of movie titles, including partial matches.
- Rate each potential match on a scale of 1-5 for relevance.
- Explain your reasoning for including or excluding partial matches.
- Justify your choice for the best match based on the user's query.

Important guidelines:
- The query will likely be in Spanish.
- Only return a movie title if it's in the provided list.
- Partial matches are acceptable (e.g., matching "El rey león" to "Mufasa: El rey león").
- One single match is preferred over multiple matches.
- If you're unsure or the intent is unclear, return an empty array.

Output format:
Your response should be a JSON object in this format:

export const byTheHourPrompt = new PromptTemplate({
  template: `
  You are an AI assistant designed to recommend movies for users in Guatemala City
  and surrounding areas. Your primary task is to analyze a user's query for time references, 
  which will be used to filter movie showings after the specified time.

Here is the user's query:

<user_query>
{userQuery}
</user_query>

Please follow these steps to analyze the query and provide a time reference:

1. Determine the language of the query. If it's in English, translate it to Spanish for analysis.
2. Analyze the query for references to specific times or time ranges.
3. Only time references for today are valid. Ignore references to other days and directly respond with null.
4. If a time reference is found:
   a. Focus only on the initial time if a range is given.
   b. Format the time as HH:MM using 24-hour notation (e.g., "14:30" for 2:30 PM).
   c. Ensure the time reference is for the current day. Ignore references to other days.
4. If no valid time reference is found, set the timeReference to null.

Conduct your time analysis inside <time_analysis> tags in your thinking block:
- If the query is in English, show the Spanish translation.
- List all time-related words or phrases found in the query.
- Consider common time expressions in both Spanish and English (e.g., "tarde", "noche", "afternoon", "evening").
- Identify any specific time references in the query.
- If a time reference is found:
  * Explain how you determined the initial time (if applicable).
  * Show the step-by-step process of converting the time to 24-hour format.
- Explain why you set timeReference to null (if applicable).

Output format:
Your final response should be a JSON object in this format:
For a match: {{"timeReference": "HH:MM"}}
For no match: {{"timeReference": null}}

Example:
Input: "muestrame la cartelera para hoy en la tarde 4:00PM to 6:00PM"
<time_analysis>
- The query is already in Spanish, no translation needed.
- Time-related words/phrases: "hoy", "tarde", "4:00PM", "6:00PM"
- Specific time reference found: "4:00PM to 6:00PM"
- Initial time is 4:00PM
- Converting to 24-hour format:
  1. Identify base time: 4:00
  2. Identify AM/PM: PM
  3. Add 12 hours for PM (except for 12:00 PM): 4:00 + 12:00 = 16:00
- Final formatted time: 16:00
- The time reference is for today, so it's valid.
</time_analysis>
{{"timeReference": "16:00"}}

Now, analyze the user's query and provide your response. Remember, it's acceptable to return null if there's no clear time reference. Your final output should consist only of the JSON object and should not duplicate or rehash any of the work you did in the thinking block.`,

3. Look for exact or semantically related matches, focusing on key words.
4. If you find multiple matches, include all of them in your response.
5. If a match is found, create a JSON object with the match(es). If no matches are found, return an empty array.

Before providing your final answer, perform your analysis inside <genre_matching> tags in your thinking block:
- If the user query is in English, translate it to Spanish (since the genre list is in Spanish).
- List out each word or phrase in the user query that might relate to a movie genre.
- For each of these words/phrases, consider possible matches from the genre list, including semantic matches.
- Rate the confidence of each match on a scale of 1-5.
- Explain your reasoning for each match or non-match.
